$ ph-reach --coop-priority -i model.ph --initial-state "cd45 1, cd28 1, tcrlig 1" ap1 1

You can try with different values for initial state, and different output activation (e.g., sre,
nfkb, nfat, ...).

The scripts run-egfr104.sh and run-tcrsig94.sh allow to handle a large number of combinations of values. You can also generate new scripts with run-generator.sh.
