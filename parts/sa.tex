\section{Static Analysis}\label{sec:sa}

\todo{Replacer notre méthode par rapport aux méthodes d'interprétation abstraite en général}

The aim of this section is to define the problem of reachability in an AAN,
and propose an under-approximation allowing to efficiently solve it.
The static analysis presented here is inspired from~\cite{PMR12-MSCS}.
We consider in this section an AAN $\PH = (\PHs; \PHl; \PHa)$.

\medskip

\modMF{
The main idea behind the static analysis presented in this section
is to abstract the dynamics of an AAN model
by a dynamics that is more general and easier to analyse.
For this, we focus on the notion of objective:
an objective is a couple of local states (\eg $\PHobj{a_i}{a_j}$) whose reachability
is required to ensure the global reachability property considered;
in other words, it is required that a set of actions hitting $a$ exists so that,
starting from a state containing $a_i$,
it is possible to play these actions (possibly intertwined with other actions)
and reach a state containing $a_j$.
Given the particular form of the actions in AANs,
the solving of such an objective raises new objectives in the general case.
%because each action can be triggered by (at most) one local state from a different automaton.
Indeed, each of these local states also have to be reached before the required actions are played.
However, the order of the considered actions is abstracted,
and so is the order of the related objectives,
thus resulting in an over-approximation of the requirements.
}



\subsection{Preliminary Definitions}
\label{ssec:sa-def}

The reachability of a local state $a_j$ of a given automaton $a$,
starting from another local state $a_i$,
is called an objective and is denoted $\PHobjp{a}{i}{j}$ (\pref{def:obj}).
\begin{definition}[Objective ($\Obj$) \& Objective Sequence ($\OS$)]
\label{def:obj}
  If $a \in \components$, the reachability of a local state $a_j$ from a local state $a_i$ is called an \emph{objective}, noted $\PHobj{a_i}{a_j}$.
  The set of all objectives is called $\Obj \DEF \{ \PHobj{a_i}{a_j} \mid a \in \components \wedge (a_i, a_j) \in \PHl_a \times \PHl_a \}$.
  For an objective $P = \PHobj{a_i}{a_j} \in \Obj$, we define: $\PHsort(P) \DEF
  a$, $\PHtarget(P)\DEF a_i$, $\PHbounce(P)\DEF a_j$,
  and $P$ is said \emph{trivial} if $a_i = a_j$.

  We define an \emph{objective sequence} as a sequence of objectives in which each objective target must be equal to the previous objective bounce of the same automaton, if it exists.
  The set of all objective sequences is denoted by $\OS$.
\end{definition}

A context (\pref{def:context}) extends the notion of state to a set of possible initial states:
\modMF{
to each automaton in the model, a context maps a set of local states in this automaton.
}
We also extend the override operator to contexts (\pref{def:ctxcap}).
\begin{definition}[Context ($\Ctx$)]
\label{def:context}
  A \emph{context} $\ctx$ associates to each automaton in $\PHs$ a non-empty subset of its local states:
  $\forall a \in \PHs, \PHget{\ctx}{a} \subseteq \PHl_a \wedge \PHget{\ctx}{a} \neq \emptyset$.
  $\Ctx$ is the set of all contexts.
\end{definition}
%
\begin{definition}[$\Cap: \Ctx \times \powerset(\PHproc) \rightarrow \Ctx$]
\label{def:ctxcap}
  For any $\ctx\in\Ctx$ and set of local states $ps \in \powerset(\PHproc)$,
  the override of $\ctx$ by $ps$ is noted $\ctx \Cap ps$ and is defined by:
  \[ \forall a \in \PHs, \PHget{(\ctx \Cap ps)}{a} \DEF
  \begin{cases}
    \{ p \in ps \mid \PHsort(p)=a \} & \text{if } \exists p \in ps, \PHsort(p)=a,\\
    \PHget{\ctx}{a} & \text{else.}
  \end{cases}
  \]
\end{definition}
\noindent
For a given context $\ctx$, we note $a_i \in \ctx$ if and only if $a_i \in \PHget{\ctx}{a}$,
and for all $ps \in \powerset(\PHproc)$ or $ps \in \PHl$, $ps \subseteq \ctx \EQDEF \forall a_i \in ps, a_i \in \ctx$.
A sequence of actions $\delta$ is \emph{playable} in a context $\ctx$ if and only if 
$\exists s \subseteq \ctx, \delta \in \Sce(s)$.
We denote then: $\delta \in \Sce(\ctx)$,
and the play of $\delta$ in $\ctx$ is $\ctx \PHplay \delta = \ctx \Cap \ceil(\delta)$,
where $\ceil(\delta)$ is the set containing the last local state in the sequence $\delta$ (hitter or bounce) of every automaton mentioned in $\delta$.

Finally, a bounce sequence on a automaton $a$ (\pref{def:bs}) is a sequence of actions hitting $a$
in which the bounce of each action equals the hitter of the following action.
Bounce sequences are used to find local solutions to a given objective;
\modMF{
indeed, the bounce sequences solving an objective $\PHobj{a_i}{a_j}$
only depend on the bounce part of the actions hitting the automaton $a$
and not on the hitters.
}%
Then, a bounce sequence on $a$ can be abstracted into
its combinations of hitters outside automaton $a$ (\pref{def:aBS});
% the minimal sets of its sets of hitters that are not in automaton $a$ (\pref{def:aBS}).
This abstraction is later used to propagate an objective on a given automaton
by creating new objectives on other automata,
by considering the sets of hitters required by the actions involved.

\begin{definition}[Bounce sequence ($\BS$)]
\label{def:bs}
  A \emph{bounce sequence} $\zeta$ is a sequence of actions so that $\forall n \in \indexes{\zeta}, n < |\zeta|, \PHbounce(\zeta_{n}) = \PHtarget(\zeta_{n+1})$.
  $\BS$ denotes the set of all bounce sequences, and
  $\BS(P)$ denotes the set of bounce sequences \emph{solving} an objective $P$:
  \[
    \BS(\PHobj{a_i}{a_j}) \DEF \{ \zeta \in \BS \mid \PHtarget(\zeta_1)= a_i \wedge \PHbounce(\zeta_{|\zeta|}) = a_j \} \enspace.
  \]
  Furthermore, $\BS(\obj{a_i}{a_j}) = \emptyset$ if there is no way to reach $a_j$ from $a_i$
  and $\emptyseq \in \BS(\obj{a_i}{a_i})$
  \modMF{
  for any trivial objective.
  }
\end{definition}

In the following, we denote: $\sSol = \powerset(\PHproc)$
\moda{%
and $\Sol = \powerset(\sSol)$.
}%
\modMF{%
The elements of $\sSol$ are sets of local states,
and will later represent sets of hitters of a given action
that are required to be active simultaneously in order to play this related action.
The elements in $\Sol$ are sets of sets of hitters,
and represent the requirements to play a whole bounce sequence.
}%

\begin{definition}[$\aBS:\Obj \rightarrow \powerset(\Sol)$]
\label{def:aBS}
  The \emph{abstractions of bounce sequences} of an objective $P$, denoted by the set $\aBS(P)$, are the minimal sets of hitters of the bounce sequences solving $P$:
  \[
    \aBS(P) \DEF \{ \abstr{\zeta} \in \Sol \mid
      \zeta \in \BS(P) \wedge
      \nexists \zeta' \in \BS(P), \abstr{\zeta'} \subsetneq \abstr{\zeta} \} \enspace,
  \]
  \modMF{
  where $\forall P \in \Obj, \forall \zeta \in \BS(P)$:
  $\abstr{\zeta} \DEF \{ \PHhitter(\zeta_n) \mid n \in \indexes{\zeta} \} \setminus \emptyset$.
  }%
  
  \noindent
  \modMF{
  As a consequence,
  $\aBS(\obj{a_i}{a_j}) = \emptyset$ if $\BS(\obj{a_i}{a_j}) = \emptyset$,
  and $\BS(\obj{a_i}{a_i}) = \{ \emptyset \}$.
  }%
\end{definition}



\subsection{Under-approximation}
\label{ssec:ua}

We denote by $\concr(\w)$ (\pref{def:concr}) the set of scenarios concretising an objective sequence $\w$ in the context $\ctx$.
In \pref{def:uconcr}, we define $\uconcr(\w)$ as equal to $\concr(\w)$ if and only if $\concr(\w)$ contains scenarios starting from all states $s \subseteq \ctx$.
\pref{lem:uconcr-ctx} is used to over-approximate the initial context $\ctx$.

\begin{definition}[$\concr: \OS \to \powerset(\Sce)$]\label{def:concr}
Given $\w\in\OS$, $\concr(\w)$ is the set of minimal scenarios concretising $\w$ in the
context $\ctx$. It is defined as the largest set satisfying the following conditions:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item $\forall\delta\in\concr(\w), \modMF{\delta\in\Sce(\ctx)}$
\item $\forall\delta\in\concr(\w),
  \exists \phi:\indexes{\w}\to\indexes{\delta},
    (\forall n,m\in\indexes{\w}, n<m \Leftrightarrow \phi(n)\leq\phi(m)),$
\\\hspace*{2cm}$\forall n\in\indexes{\w}, \PHbounce(\w_n) \in \ctx\play\delta_{1..\phi(n)}$
\item $\forall\delta,\delta'\in\concr(\w)
				\card{\delta}\leq\card{\delta'} \Rightarrow
					\delta\neq\delta'_{1..\card{\delta}}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\noindent
The notation $\delta_{a..b}$ in the previous definition
denotes the subsequence of $\delta$ between indexes $a$ and $b$,
as defined on page \pageref{notations}.

\begin{definition}[$\uconcr: \OS \rightarrow \powerset(\Sce)$]
\label{def:uconcr}
  \[
  \modMF{\forall \w \in \OS,}
  \uconcr(\w) \DEF
  \begin{cases}
    \concr(\w) & \text{if } \forall s \in \PHl, s \subseteq \ctx, \exists \delta \in \concr(\w), \delta \in \Sce(s) \\
    \emptyset & \text{else.}
  \end{cases}
  \]
\end{definition}
% 
\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:uconcr-ctx}
  $\ctx \subseteq \ctx' \wedge \muconcr_{\ctx'}(\w) \neq \emptyset \Longrightarrow \muconcr_{\ctx}(\w) \neq \emptyset$.
\end{lemma}

For any objective $P$ and context $\ctx$, \pref{def:maxCont} gives the set of local states of automaton $\PHsort(P)$ that are required to solve $P$ in $\ctx$, denoted by $\gCont_\ctx(\PHsort(P), P)$.
\begin{definition}[$\gCont_\ctx : \Sigma \times \Obj \rightarrow \powerset(\PHproc)$]
  \label{def:maxCont}
  \begin{align*}
    \gCont_\ctx(a,P) \DEF
    \{ p \in \PHproc &\mid \exists ps \in \aBS(P), \exists b_i \in ps, b = a \wedge p = b_i \\
      & \vee b \neq a \wedge p \in \gCont_\ctx(a, \PHobj{b_j}{b_i}) \wedge b_j \in \PHget{\ctx}{b} \}
    \enspace.
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}

\modMF{
A graph of local causality $\myB = (\cwV, \cwE)$
is a graph where $\cwV \subseteq \Proc \cup \Obj \cup \sSol \cup \Sol$ is the set of vertices
and $\cwE \subseteq \cwV \times \cwV$ is the set of oriented edges.
Such a graph aims a describing the requirements of a given reachability
problem, that is, the reachability of $\w$ from the initial context $\ctx$.
Thus, a node in $\PHproc$ represents a local state required to play an action,
a node in $\Obj$ is an objective to reach a given local state,
a node in $\sSol$ is a set of hitters that have to be active simultaneously
to solve one step of a given objective,
and a node in $\Sol$ is a set of sets of hitters,
thus encompassing all requirement for the solving of a whole objective.
}

\modMF{
The edges of such a graph allow to draw links between these requirements.
Thus, an objective $P \in \Obj$ is solvable if
at least one related bounce sequence in $\BS(P)$ can be played;
therefore, we can consider all minimal sets of sets of hitters of these bounce sequences
(that is, the sets of $\aBS(P) \subseteq \Sol$, see \pref{def:aBS})
as requirements to solve this objective (\pref{eq:ESol1}).
Such a set can then naturally be split into as many sets of hitters (\pref{eq:ESol3})
which all have to be simultaneously active.
These sets of hitters can in turn be split into several local state nodes (\pref{eq:ESol2}).
This creates new requirements, as the reachability of a required local state $a_i$
is approximated by the ability to solve all objectives of the form
$\PHobjp{a}{j}{i} \in \Obj$ for all $a_j$ in the initial context (\pref{eq:EReq}).
Furthermore, we note that the solving of an objective $P$ may require
a local state of $\PHsort(P)$,
\ie $\gCont(\PHsort(P), P) \neq \emptyset$ (see \pref{def:maxCont});
in this case, $P$ is re-targeted (\pref{eq:ECont}).
Finally, \pref{eq:Vw} and \eqref{eq:Vproc}
force the graph to contain all the initial objectives
and the related local states,
and \pref{eq:VE} ensures the consistency of $\cwV$.
}

\modMF{
However, this graph $\myB$ alone is not sufficient to check the reachability of
an objective sequence $\w$ from an initial context $\ctx$;
indeed, the reachability of each intermediate required local state
is only checked starting from the context $\ctx$,
although this context may be modified by other objectives.
Therefore, such a reachability requires the building of the
\emph{saturated graph of local causality} (\pref{def:glc})
which is obtained by iteratively saturating the initial context with all
local states referenced in the graph,
until reaching a fixed point.
Such a fixed point always exists because the size of the context
is limited by the size of the initial PH model.
The set of local states contained in a graph of local causality
is given by:
\begin{align*}
  \allprocs(\cwV, \cwE) = (\cwV \cap \Proc) &\cup \{ \PHtarget(P) \mid P \in \cwV \cap \Obj \}\\
  & \cup \{ \PHbounce(P) \mid P \in \cwV \cap \Obj \wedge P \neq \w \}
\end{align*}
where, if the objective sequence $\w$ consists of only one element,
we can omit the hitter of this objective
provided that it does not appear elsewhere in the graph.
}

\begin{definition}
\label{def:glc}
  The \emph{\modMF{saturated} graph of local causality} $\cwB \DEF (\Bv, \Be)$ is defined as:
  $\cwB \DEF \lfp{\aB^\w_\ctx}{\myB}{\aB^\w_{\ctx \Cap \allprocs(\myB)}}$,
  where $\myB \DEF (\cwV, \cwE)$ is the smallest graph with
  $\cwV \subseteq \Proc \cup \Obj \cup \sSol \cup \Sol$ and $\cwE \subseteq \cwV \times \cwV$
  so that:
  \begin{align}
    \modMF{\toset{\w}} &\subseteq \cwV \label{eq:Vw} \\
    P \in \cwVObj &\Rightarrow \PHbounce(P) \in \cwV \label{eq:Vproc} \\
    (x, y) \in \cwE &\Rightarrow y \in \cwV \label{eq:VE} \\
    P \in \cwVObj \wedge pps \in \modMF{\aBS}(P) &\Rightarrow (P, pps) \in \cwE \label{eq:ESol1} \\
    \moda{pps \in \cwVSol \wedge A \in pps} &\moda{\Rightarrow (pps, A) \in \cwE} \label{eq:ESol3} \\
    A \in \cwVsSol \wedge a_i \in A &\Rightarrow (A, a_i) \in \cwE \label{eq:ESol2} \\
    a_i \in \cwVProc \wedge a_j \in \ctx &\Rightarrow (a_i, \PHobjp{a}{j}{i}) \in \cwE \label{eq:EReq} \\
%    a \in \cs \wedge a_i \in \cwVProc \wedge ps \in \csState(a_i) &\Rightarrow (a_i, ps) \in \cwE \label{eq:EPrio} \\
    P \in \cwVObj \wedge q \in \gCont_\ctx(\PHsort(P), P) &\Rightarrow (P, \PHobj{q}{\PHbounce(P)}) \in \cwE \label{eq:ECont} \!
  \end{align}
\end{definition}

\modMF{
In the saturated graph of local causality, a set of hitters $A \in \sSol$
is said to be \emph{coherent} (\pref{def:coherent})
if none of the local states in $A$ conflict with
a successor of $A$ in $\Bv \cap \Proc$,
that is, if there exists no local state node $a_j$ in the successors of $A$
and no element $a_i \in A$ so that $a_i \neq a_j$.
}
Then, \pref{th:approxinf} gives a sufficient condition for the concretisation
of an objective sequence in a given context,
which is derived immediately from the saturated graph of local causality,
and the condition that all sets of hitters are coherent.
A proof of this theorem is given in \pref{suppl:demoapproxinf}.
\begin{definition}[Coherent node]
\label{def:coherent}
  \modMF{
  In a given saturated graph of local causality $\cwB = (\Bv, \Be)$,
  a node $x \in \Bv$ is said to be \emph{coherent} if and only if:
  $x \in \Bv \cap \sSol \Rightarrow x$ has no successor $a_j \in \Bv \cap \Proc$
  so that $\exists a_i \in x$, $a_i \neq a_j$.
  }
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Under-Approximation]
\label{th:approxinf}
  Given an AAN $(\PHs; \PHl; \PHa)$,
  a context $\ctx$ and an objective sequence $\w$,
  if the graph $\cwB$ contains no cycle,
  all objectives have at least one solution
  and all nodes are coherent,
  then $\uconcr(\w) \neq \emptyset$.
\end{theorem}

\modMF{
Regarding the complexity of the method,
computing the saturated graph of local causality is polynomial in the number of automata in $\PH$ and exponential in the number of local states in one automaton.
Checking the properties allowing to apply \pref{th:approxinf} is polynomial in the size of the graph.
Therefore, the building and checking process can be considered as polynomial in the size
of the AAN, provided that each automaton only contains a few local states.
We note that this is particularly true for biological models, where
each component usually contains a limited number of expression levels.
}

\modMF{
We note furthermore that in the case where
the method developed in this section is not conclusive,
it is possible to compute only a subset of $\Bv \cap \Sol$,
by removing some solutions from the initial graph of local causality $\myB$,
or by removing them from the saturated graph of local causality $\cwB$ and by trimming it.
In other words, this consists in ignoring some of the bounce sequences
for some of the objectives,
which intuitively cannot create false positives.
Indeed, \pref{th:approxinf} is then still valid on the partial graph obtained,
and this removal can lead to more conclusiveness by trimming parts of the graph
that were not necessary for the reachability
(especially cycles or unnecessary but inconclusive branches).
If one wants to try each possible subset of solutions,
then the overall method turns out to be exponential
in the number of solutions to each objective.
Our method can thus still be considered as efficient
compared to regular model-checking which is usually PSPACE-complete~\cite{Harel02}.
}



\begin{example}
  \moda{%
  If we confider the AAN of \pref{fig:ph-livelock},
  from the initial state $\PHstate{a_1, b_0, c_0}$ depicted,
  the under-approximation given in \pref{th:approxinf}
  does not conclude regarding the reachability of $c_1$.
  This is due to the fact that the node $\{ a_1, b_1 \} \in \Bv \cap \sSol$
  is not coherent because of its successor $a_0$ (and $b_0$).
  (However, from the inconclusiveness of \pref{th:approxinf},
  one cannot conclude about the unreachability of $c_1$.
  Such analysis should be driven for instance
  with over-approximation methods developed in~\cite{PMR12-MSCS}.)
  }%
  
  \modMF{%
  This result is new compared to the method proposed in~\cite{PMR12-MSCS}.
  Indeed, the representation based on the Process Hitting that was proposed
  in this paper only allowed to represent “over-approximated” Boolean gates
  with the use of cooperative sorts.
  This especially did not allow to model the fact that $a_1$ and $b_1$ could not
  be activated in the same state, but only in successive states.
  Thus, when using Process Hitting, $c_1$ was indeed reachable,
  contrary to the behaviour expected from an accurate Boolean gate.
  }%
  
  \moda{%
  Finally, we note however that,
  if $\PHhits{a_0}{b_0}{b_1}$ and $\PHhits{b_0}{a_0}{a_1}$ are replaced by the actions
  $\PHhitm{a_0}{a_1}$ and $\PHhitm{b_0}{b_1}$,
  then the resulting saturated graph of local causality changes, and
  \pref{th:approxinf} concludes that $c_1$ is reachable from $\ctx$.
  The reader can also refer to \pref{ssec:ex-metazoan}
  for a detailed conclusive example.

\subsection{Reachability of a State}
\label{ssec:simult-ua}

\newcommand{\total}{\tau}
\newcommand{\reach}{\sigma}

The reachability property studied so far concerns a single local state at a time.
However, we remark that the reachability of a global state or a sub-state can be
addressed with the very same analysis by introducing a dedicated automata.
Such analysis was not possible with the Process Hitting framework,
because of the lack of the notion of simultaneity for more than two components.

In order to check the reachability of a global state $s \in \PHl$,
let $\PH = (\PHs, \PHl, \PHh)$ be an AAN.
We define a new AAN $\PH' = (\PHs', \PHl', \PHh')$ with:
$\PHs' = \PHs \cup \{ \reach \}$, $\PHl' = \PHl \times \PHl_\reach$,
where $\PHl_\reach = \{ \reach_0, \reach_1 \}$,
and $\PHh' = \PHh \cup \{ \PHhit{\toset{s}}{\reach_0}{\reach_1} \}$.
Given an initial context $\ctx$, the reachability of $s$ in $\PH$
is equivalent to the concretisation of $\PHobjp{\reach}{0}{1}$ in $\PH'$
from the initial context $\ctx \cup \{ \reach_0 \}$,
which can be efficiently under-approximated using \pref{th:approxinf}.

It is of course also possible to compute the reachability
of a sub-state $s \in \PHsubl[\PHl]_S$ of a set of components $S \subseteq \PHs$
with the same method.
One can also check the reachability of a set of states $\Lambda \subseteq \PHl$
by creating several actions
$\PHhit{\toset{s}}{\reach_0}{\reach_1}$ in $\PHh$ for each state $s \in \Lambda$.



\subsection{Sequential Under-approximation}
\label{ssec:ordered-ua}

In this section, we briefly explain an alternative sufficient condition that
progressively takes into account the successive objectives, instead of
considering all of them at a time, as it is done in \pref{ssec:ua}.
Because objectives are taken into account individually, such an approach
considers only a subset of scenarios.
However, because each iteration focuses on a smaller part of the network, this
sequential under-approximation may be more conclusive.

Let us define a sequence of objectives $\w=\obj{a_i}{a_j}\concat\w'$ with
$a_i\neq a_j$ and a state $s\in \PHl$ with $\get{s}{a}=a_i$.
One can remark that any scenario reaching $a_j$ necessarily includes one of the
bounce sequences in $\BS(\obj{a_i}{a_j})$, and, in particular,
any minimal scenario reaching $a_j$ ends in a state where $a_j$ is present but
also the hitters of the last bounce of one bounce sequence in $\BS(\obj{a_i}{a_j})$.
\pref{def:lastprocs} defines $\lastprocs(\obj{a_i}{a_j})$ as the set of set of
local states that may be present just after reaching $a_j$.

\begin{definition}[$\lastprocs : \Obj\to\Sol$]
\label{def:lastprocs}
  Given an objective $\obj{a_i}{a_j} \in \Obj$, $\lastprocs(\obj{a_i}{a_j})$ is
  defined as the largest set such that, $\forall ps\in\lastprocs(\obj{a_i}{a_j})$, 
  $ps\in\sSol$,
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $a_j \in ps$;
    \item $\exists \zeta \in \BS(\obj{a_i}{a_j}),
      \hitter{\zeta_{\card{\zeta}}} \subseteq ps$;
    \item $\nexists ps' \in \lastprocs(\obj{a_i}{a_j}),
      ps' \subset ps \wedge ps' \neq ps$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

From \pref{th:approxinf}, we can deduce that
for any scenario $\delta$ in $\uconcr(P)$,
there exists a set of local states $ps\in\lastprocs(P)$
such that $ps \subseteq (s\play\delta)$.
Hence, if $\muconcr_{\ctx'\Cap ps}(\w')\neq\emptyset$,
with $\ctx'=\ctx\Cap\procs(\mycwB{\ctx}{P})$,
there exists a scenario $\delta'$ concretising $\w'$ from the
state $(s\play\delta)$.
Therefore, the scenario $\delta\concat\delta'$ concretises
$\w$.

\begin{theorem}[Sequential under-approximation]
\label{thm:ordered-ua}
Given an AAN $(\PHs; \PHl; \PHa)$,
a context $\ctx$ and an objective sequence $\w =
P\concat\w'\in\OS$,
$\uconcr(P)\neq\emptyset \wedge
	\forall ps \in\lastprocs(P),
	\muconcr_{\ctx'\Cap ps}(\w')\neq\emptyset
	\Longrightarrow \uconcr(\w)\neq\emptyset$,
where $\ctx' = \ctx\Cap\procs(\mycwB{\ctx}{P})$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
If $\uconcr(P)\neq\emptyset$,
for all $s\in \PHl, s\subseteq\ctx$,
there exists a scenario $\delta\in\uconcr(P)\cap\Sce(s)$;
from \pref{def:lastprocs} and proof of \pref{th:approxinf},
$\exists ps\in\lastprocs(P)$ such that
$(s\play\delta)\subseteq\ctx'\Cap ps$.
Hence, if $\muconcr_{\ctx'\Cap ps}(\w')\neq\emptyset$,
there exists a scenario $\delta'\in\muconcr_{\ctx'\Cap ps}(\w')$ such that
$\delta'\in\Sce(s\play\delta)$.
Hence, $\delta\concat\delta'$ is a scenario playable in $s$.
Therefore, for all $s\in \PHl, s\subseteq\ctx$, there exists a scenario
concretising $\w$.
Hence, $\uconcr(\w)\neq\emptyset$.
\end{proof}

This section gives a recursive method to find a scenario that concretizes
a given objective sequence $\w \in \OS$.
All the definitions above are well-defined provided that
$\uconcr(\w)\neq\emptyset$,
which can be demonstrated by \pref{th:approxinf} or \pref{thm:ordered-ua}.
The justification of these definitions can be found by analysing the demonstrations
of these theorems.

\modMF{%
First, $\osres$ is used to split the objective sequence $\w$ to solve,
by considering successive objectives, in the fashion of \pref{thm:ordered-ua}.
This function calls $\res$ which allows to solve an objective $P$
by either re-target it (if $\gCont(\PHsort(P), P) \neq \emptyset$)
of by searching for a solution to this objective in $\BS(P)$.
This search may require to try several objective sequences $\zeta \in \BS(P)$.
For each trial, the chosen objective sequence $\zeta$ is solved with $\rec$,
which recursively created a scenario to play the whole sequence.
This scenario is itself recursively created by combining
smaller scenarios allowing to reach each required hitter of each action
with the function $\thisseq$.
Finally, $\thisseq$ calls $\res$ anew to reach the hitters
that are necessarily contained in other automata.
In the end, a scenario can be obtained by analysing all values of
$\osres_s(\w)$ (\pref{def:concret})
for all possible initial state $s \subseteq \ctx$ in the considered context,
and all possible bounce sequences $\zeta \in \BS(P)$ that are chosen during the resolution.
